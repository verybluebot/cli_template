# Golang CLI Template
## Getting started

```
// get project files
git clone https://github.com/verybluebot/golang_cli_template.git
```

Then `cd` into project root directory and use `make` utility to build the binary:
```
make all
```

Now you can go on and create your own program using this as a template!
